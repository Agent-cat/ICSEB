        <h3>Conference Proceedings</h3>
        <p>
          All papers submitted to the <strong>1<sup>st</sup> IEEE International Conference on
          Advanced Innovations in Intelligent Computing, Smart Electronics and
          Bioinformatics (ICSEB 2026)</strong> will undergo a rigorous peer-review process
          by the Technical Program Committee and expert reviewers.

        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Accepted and presented papers</strong> will be compiled in the official
            conference proceedings.

          <li>
            The conference proceedings will be <strong>submitted to IEEE for publication in
            IEEE Xplore&reg;</strong>, subject to <strong>IEEE quality review and approval</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once published in IEEE Xplore&reg;, papers are expected to be discoverable

          <li>
            IEEE reserves the right to <strong>exclude papers</strong> from publication in

        <h3>Review &amp; Selection Policy</h3>
        <p>
          ICSEB 2026 follows a structured, multi-stage review process to ensure the
          quality and relevance of accepted papers.
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>
            The conference adopts a <strong>single-blind peer review</strong> process:
            reviewers know the identity of authors, but authors do not know the
            identity of reviewers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each submitted paper will typically be evaluated by
            <strong>at least two independent reviewers</strong> (and a third reviewer if
            required) drawn from the <strong>Technical Program Committee</strong> and expert
            domain reviewers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reviewers will assess papers based on:
            <ul class="clean-list" style="margin-top:3px;">
              <li>Originality and technical contribution</li>
              <li>Relevance to the conference themes and tracks</li>
              <li>Technical correctness and soundness of methodology</li>
              <li>Quality of experimental results / analysis</li>
              <li>Clarity of presentation and organization</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Final decisions (accept / reject / conditional accept) will be taken by
            the <strong>Technical Program Chairs</strong> in consultation with Track Chairs,
            based on reviewers’ comments, plagiarism check and overall balance of the
            technical program.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authors will receive consolidated review comments and may be requested to
            incorporate mandatory changes in the <strong>camera-ready version</strong> to meet
            IEEE formatting and quality standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Papers that do not pass the technical review, plagiarism threshold or
            ethical screening will be <strong>rejected</strong>, irrespective of registration
            status.
